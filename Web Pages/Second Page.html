    <big><h1 style="color:DarkSlateGrey">Current Influence of Creativity on Technology</h1></big>
    <p> Let’s go through some of the major implications Creativity has had on Technology:-
    <a id="C">
    <br><br><br>
    <h2 style="color:Crimson; font-weight: bold;"><i><big>1. <u>WHAT IS CREATIVITY</u></h2></big>
    <p>Creativity in the ability to combine ideas in a unique way or to make useful association among ideas. Creativity provides new ideas for quality improvement in organizations and innovation puts these ideas into action.
    <p><img src="2nd page 2nd.jpg" style="width:60%">
    <p>In today’s time Creativity is enhancing how technology affect our lifestyle, social life, economic change. Creativity is a key part of innovation and technology and is the reason for exponential growth of technology and it becoming streamlined.

    <strong><h2 style="color:Crimson; font-weight: bold;"><i><big>2. <u>How Creativity is an Integral part of Technology</u></i></h2></strong></big>
    <p>1. <b><U>Forming intent:</u> Every creative act starts with a purpose.  Whether it is a marketer trying to solve for a particular business objective, a designer working with a specific brief or an artist looking to express a distinct idea or emotion.  It is through forming intent that we establish the constraints under which creativity thrives.
    <p>2.	<b><u>Searching The Domain</u>:  All great artists—or for that matter, anybody who is good at anything—are students of their craft.  By thoroughly examining their domain, they become aware of a variety of techniques, alternative approaches and different philosophies.  The larger the creative toolbox, the greater the possibility for creative excellence.
    <p>3. <b><u>Economic Success</u>: Next step includes developing technology and testing it. But there is a reason which prevents many cutting edge technology to become daily use tech. This reason is CREATIVITY.
    <p>It is Creativity that enhances the utility of a technology and ultimately leads it to becoming a household technology.  And hence uncovers and enhances the full potential of technology.
    </a>
    <a id="TCHH">
    <br><br><br><br>
    <strong><h2 style="color:Crimson; font-weight: bold;"><b><big>3. <u>Creativity and Technology go Hand in Hand: Study</u></b></h2></strong></big>
    <p>According to a research, more than half of the respondents expressed interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and what they add to the creative process. Just 12% of respondents said they were totally uninterested.
    <p><center><img src="Pie1.png" style="width:50%"></center>
    <p>“Creatives were on the fence when it came to AI just a few months ago,” said Chris Duffey, senior manager of AI strategic development at Adobe, in an exclusive interview with CMO.com. “Today they realize that AI is in much of the technology they’re already using, and it’s making things more intuitive than previously perceived.”

    <p>Seventy-four percent of respondents noted that they spend more than half their time on tedious, uncreative tasks, which is where they see the most potential for AI and machine learning.
    <p>“I think there’s been an overemphasis on the tech piece over the past couple of years, and today we are at a place with AI where creatives can get back to that core, instinctual affinity for creating and being makers,” Duffey said. “AI is going to allow them to move from creatives to creators.”

    <br><br><br><br>
    <strong><h2 style="color:Crimson; font-weight: bold;"><i><big>4. <u>Rise of Creative Class</u></i></h2></strong></big>
    <p>Probably the strongest sign that technology enhances creativity is that, as Richard Florida argues in The Rise Of The Creative Class, creativity is becoming an intrinsic part of working life.  The man in the gray flannel suit has been replaced by the hipster with spiky hair and tattoos. As we become a more technological society, we also become a more creative society, because many of the rote tasks that used to take up a lot of our time and effort have become automated.  What’s more, technology increases our potential to engage in the types of experiences that lead to greater creativity.

    <b><h2 style="color:Crimson; font-weight: bold;"><big>5. <u>Eradicating Barriers</u></h2></b></big>
    <p>Luck and chance have always played a role in creativity. Also, history is full of examples of missed opportunities because of deficiencies of information. Darwin’s theory remained incomplete for half a century, because he was not able to specify a mechanism by which traits were inherited. Ironically, his contemporary, Gregor Mendel, had discovered the principles of genetics shortly after Darwin published his famous work, but they remained completely unaware of each other for their entire lifetimes.
